# KLit

an app for reading korean liturature

## TODO

the dictionary api can only handle dictornary forms of words. in order to handle real writing, when we are not able to find a translation, iteratively peel back 'letters' off the end of the word until we find a translation. this wont work all the time, but should work fairly often.
